# Linear-Regression-Bike-Sharing-Assignment
> To use the given independent factors to model the demand for shared bikes. The management will use it to determine precisely how the needs change with changing features. They can adjust their business approach in accordance with demand levels and client expectations. The model will also help management better grasp the dynamics of demand in a new market.

## General Information
- A bike-sharing system is a service in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis.
- BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic
- The business probem that this project is trying to solve is the factors affecting the demand for these shared bikes in the American market. So that Company can prepare themselves to cater to the people's needs once the situation gets better all around and stand out from other service providers and make huge profits.
- Dataset (day.csv) -Based on various meteorological surveys and people's styles, the service provider firm has gathered a large dataset on daily bike demands across the American market based on some factors.



## Conclusions
- Demand of Bikes is impacted positively by the year, temp , winter , sep - so at this time of the year demand will be more.
- Demand is Negatively imppacted by holiday, windspeed ,Light_snowrain, Misty, spring, july so booking will be low at these time of the year
